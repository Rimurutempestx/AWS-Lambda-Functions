## AWS-Lambda-Functions
A list of basic everyday functions used in AWS Lambda. This repository will be divided into different sections, based on the way AWS Lambda integrates with other AWS services. All these Lambda functions will be created using Python scripts.

## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Image resizing: Lambda functions can be used to resize images stored in S3 buckets.
- File processing: Lambda functions can be triggered to process files as soon as they are uploaded to S3 buckets.
- Data transformation: Lambda functions can transform data files in S3 buckets to different formats for use in other applications.
- Real-time data processing: Lambda functions can be triggered in real-time to process data stored in S3 buckets as soon as it's added or updated.
- Website hosting: Lambda functions can be used to host static websites that are stored in S3 buckets.
- Archiving: Lambda functions can be used to move files that are stored in S3 buckets to lower cost storage options as they age or are no longer needed.
- Event-based processing: Lambda functions can be triggered by events occurring in S3 buckets, such as object creation, deletion, or modification.
- Backup and disaster recovery: Lambda functions can be used to backup data stored in S3 buckets and to restore data in case of disasters.
- Search indexing: Lambda functions can be used to index and search data stored in S3 buckets.
- Security and compliance: Lambda functions can be used to monitor and enforce security and compliance policies on data stored in S3 buckets.

## Amazon DynamoDB

- Data Validation and reprocessing: You can use Lambda functions to validate or preprocess data before it's stored in DynamoDB. For example, you can use a Lambda function to check if the data meets certain criteria, sanitize user inputs, or transform data into a different format.
