## AWS-Lambda-Functions
A list of basic everyday functions used in AWS Lambda. This repository will be divided into different sections, based on the way AWS Lambda integrates with other AWS services. All these Lambda functions will be created using Python scripts.

## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Image resizing: Lambda functions can be used to resize images stored in S3 buckets.
- File processing: Lambda functions can be triggered to process files as soon as they are uploaded to S3 buckets.
- Data transformation: Lambda functions can transform data files in S3 buckets to different formats for use in other applications.
- Real-time data processing: Lambda functions can be triggered in real-time to process data stored in S3 buckets as soon as it's added or updated.
- Website hosting: Lambda functions can be used to host static websites that are stored in S3 buckets.
- Archiving: Lambda functions can be used to move files that are stored in S3 buckets to lower cost storage options as they age or are no longer needed.
- Event-based processing: Lambda functions can be triggered by events occurring in S3 buckets, such as object creation, deletion, or modification.
- Backup and disaster recovery: Lambda functions can be used to backup data stored in S3 buckets and to restore data in case of disasters.
- Search indexing: Lambda functions can be used to index and search data stored in S3 buckets.
- Security and compliance: Lambda functions can be used to monitor and enforce security and compliance policies on data stored in S3 buckets.

## Amazon DynamoDB

- Data Validation and reprocessing: You can use Lambda functions to validate or preprocess data before it's stored in DynamoDB. For example, you can use a Lambda function to check if the data meets certain criteria, sanitize user inputs, or transform data into a different format.
- Indexing and querying: You can use Lambda functions to create indexes or handle complex queries that aren't supported by DynamoDB out of the box. Lambda functions can help you create custom indexes or search algorithms, which can help you speed up queries or provide additional functionality.
- Real-time stream processing: DynamoDB Streams allows you to capture changes to your data in real-time. You can use Lambda functions to process these streams and perform additional actions based on the data changes.
- Backup and archival: You can use Lambda functions to automatically backup or archive data from DynamoDB to other storage services like Amazon S3. This can help you ensure that you have a reliable and secure backup of your data.
- Aggregation and analytics: You can use Lambda functions to aggregate data from DynamoDB and perform analytics on it. This can help you gain insights into your data or create dashboards that display key metrics.
- Access control: You can use Lambda functions to enforce access control policies on your DynamoDB data. For example, you can use Lambda functions to check if a user is authorized to read or write data to a specific table.
- Event-driven architecture: You can use Lambda functions to create event-driven architectures that respond to changes in DynamoDB data. This can help you build complex workflows that react to real-time events.
- Data migration: You can use Lambda functions to migrate data from other data stores to DynamoDB. Lambda functions can help you transform data from different formats or handle complex data migrations.
- Notifications and alerts: You can use Lambda functions to send notifications or alerts based on changes to your DynamoDB data. This can help you create real-time monitoring and alerting systems.
- Machine learning: You can use Lambda functions to integrate machine learning models with DynamoDB. This can help you perform real-time predictions on your data or automate decision-making based on machine learning models.

## RDS (Relational Database Service)

- Data schema updates: You can use Lambda functions to automatically update database schemas in RDS. Lambda functions can help you handle schema migrations and versioning.
- Automated backup:  You can use Lambda functions to schedule automated backups of your RDS databases. This can help you ensure that your data is always backed up and recoverable.
- Database replication: You can use Lambda functions to automatically replicate data between multiple RDS instances. This can help you ensure that your data is always available and accessible.
- Database auditing: You can use Lambda functions to audit database activity in RDS. Lambda functions can help you log changes to your database and identify potential security issues.
- User management: You can use Lambda functions to manage user access and permissions in RDS. Lambda functions can help you enforce role-based access control and automatically create or delete users.
- Performance tuning: You can use Lambda functions to automatically optimize database performance in RDS. Lambda functions can help you identify and fix performance bottlenecks in your database.
- Data encryption: You can use Lambda functions to automatically encrypt data at rest in RDS. Lambda functions can help you ensure that your data is always protected and compliant.
- Compliance monitoring: You can use Lambda functions to monitor RDS for compliance with various regulations and industry standards. Lambda functions can help you identify potential compliance issues and take corrective action.
- Disaster recovery: You can use Lambda functions to automatically failover to a secondary RDS instance in the event of a primary instance failure. Lambda functions can help you ensure that your data is always available and recoverable.
- Data masking and obfuscation: You can use Lambda functions to automatically mask or obfuscate sensitive data in RDS. Lambda functions can help you ensure that your data is always protected and anonymized.

## Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

- Cluster management: You can use Lambda functions to manage your EKS clusters by automating tasks such as scaling, monitoring, and backup.
- Application deployment: You can use Lambda functions to automate the deployment of your applications in EKS. This can include tasks such as building and packaging code, testing, and deploying to production.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): You can use Lambda functions to automate your CI/CD pipelines in EKS, enabling you to continuously deliver new features and updates to your applications.
- Kubernetes resource management: You can use Lambda functions to manage Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, and deployments. This can include tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting resources.
- Custom resource management: You can use Lambda functions to manage custom resources in EKS, allowing you to create and manage your own Kubernetes resources.
- Scaling: You can use Lambda functions to scale your EKS clusters based on predefined rules or conditions. This can help you ensure that your application can handle increased traffic and demand.
- Event-driven architectures: You can use Lambda functions to create event-driven architectures in EKS, enabling you to respond to changes in your environment or application.
- Monitoring: You can use Lambda functions to monitor your EKS clusters and applications, enabling you to identify and address issues in real-time.
- Security: You can use Lambda functions to automate security tasks such as patching and vulnerability scanning in EKS, helping you to keep your application and infrastructure secure.
- Compliance: You can use Lambda functions to automate compliance tasks such as auditing and reporting in EKS, helping you to maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Amazon Redshift

- Query scheduling: You can use Lambda functions to schedule and execute Redshift queries on a regular basis. This can help you automate reporting or other data-related tasks.
- Data transformations: You can use Lambda functions to transform data before loading it into Redshift. This can include tasks such as data validation, normalization, and data type conversions.
- Data loading:  You can use Lambda functions to load data into Redshift from a variety of sources. This can include tasks such as integrating with S3, Kinesis, or other data sources.
