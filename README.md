## AWS-Lambda-Functions
A list of basic everyday functions used in AWS Lambda. This repository will be divided into different sections, based on the way AWS Lambda integrates with other AWS services. All these Lambda functions will be created using Python scripts.

## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Image resizing: Lambda functions can be used to resize images stored in S3 buckets.
- File processing: Lambda functions can be triggered to process files as soon as they are uploaded to S3 buckets.
- Data transformation: Lambda functions can transform data files in S3 buckets to different formats for use in other applications.
- Real-time data processing: Lambda functions can be triggered in real-time to process data stored in S3 buckets as soon as it's added or updated.
- Website hosting: Lambda functions can be used to host static websites that are stored in S3 buckets.
- Archiving: Lambda functions can be used to move files that are stored in S3 buckets to lower cost storage options as they age or are no longer needed.
- Event-based processing: Lambda functions can be triggered by events occurring in S3 buckets, such as object creation, deletion, or modification.
- Backup and disaster recovery: Lambda functions can be used to backup data stored in S3 buckets and to restore data in case of disasters.
- Search indexing: Lambda functions can be used to index and search data stored in S3 buckets.
- Security and compliance: Lambda functions can be used to monitor and enforce security and compliance policies on data stored in S3 buckets.

## Amazon DynamoDB

- Data Validation and reprocessing: You can use Lambda functions to validate or preprocess data before it's stored in DynamoDB. For example, you can use a Lambda function to check if the data meets certain criteria, sanitize user inputs, or transform data into a different format.
- Indexing and querying: You can use Lambda functions to create indexes or handle complex queries that aren't supported by DynamoDB out of the box. Lambda functions can help you create custom indexes or search algorithms, which can help you speed up queries or provide additional functionality.
- Real-time stream processing: DynamoDB Streams allows you to capture changes to your data in real-time. You can use Lambda functions to process these streams and perform additional actions based on the data changes.
- Backup and archival: You can use Lambda functions to automatically backup or archive data from DynamoDB to other storage services like Amazon S3. This can help you ensure that you have a reliable and secure backup of your data.
- Aggregation and analytics: You can use Lambda functions to aggregate data from DynamoDB and perform analytics on it. This can help you gain insights into your data or create dashboards that display key metrics.
- Access control: You can use Lambda functions to enforce access control policies on your DynamoDB data. For example, you can use Lambda functions to check if a user is authorized to read or write data to a specific table.
- Event-driven architecture: You can use Lambda functions to create event-driven architectures that respond to changes in DynamoDB data. This can help you build complex workflows that react to real-time events.
- Data migration: You can use Lambda functions to migrate data from other data stores to DynamoDB. Lambda functions can help you transform data from different formats or handle complex data migrations.
- Notifications and alerts: You can use Lambda functions to send notifications or alerts based on changes to your DynamoDB data. This can help you create real-time monitoring and alerting systems.
- Machine learning: You can use Lambda functions to integrate machine learning models with DynamoDB. This can help you perform real-time predictions on your data or automate decision-making based on machine learning models.

## RDS (Relational Database Service)

- Data schema updates: You can use Lambda functions to automatically update database schemas in RDS. Lambda functions can help you handle schema migrations and versioning.
