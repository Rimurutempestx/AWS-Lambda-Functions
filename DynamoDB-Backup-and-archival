# This code defines a Lambda function that extracts data from a DynamoDB table (my-dynamodb-table), retrieves all items, creates an S3 client, and then loops through the items, uploading them to an S3 bucket (my-s3-bucket-name) with the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. Once the data has been uploaded, the function returns a status code of 200, along with a message indicating that the data has been moved to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
